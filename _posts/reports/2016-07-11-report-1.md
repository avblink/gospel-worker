Gospel Worker 2014 Christian foundation is working in Hungarian city of Székesfehérvár.
Its founder and director is also a member of Seventh Day Adventist Church. Our goal is helping poor families, collection and distribution of offerings and food.

Between 2016-06-20 and 2016-06-26 two local bakeries started offering from their produce: pizzas, hot sandwiches, sweet pastries, buns with dairy fillings and everything else one would find in a bakery store. Up to date we've received food offerings worth of ~USD365 (HUF104 000).

We've forwarded food to kids camp where 40 school age kids could have it for breakfast  worth of HUF 27000. 
Took food to homeless who live in cardboard boxes in the woods  worth of HUF 11800. 
Fed poor families  worth HUF 27180.
Took part in outdoors event with another charity organization where we gave away bakery, warm food and drinks to over 100 people  worth HUF 37390.
Took a car full of food to a distant city of Kisbér (40km) where more then 10 families could eat.


Food collection happens every evening at 9pm and the following day it gets given away to the needy.

At present we find difficulties with storage space and refrigeration. We are trying to find and rent an appropriate place. It's also difficult to transport the food since the foundation doesn't have its own transport. A couple of church members offered their cars which they run at their own expense. Once we solve these obstacles we could accept and distribute more offerings and thus have access to even more hungry families.

We strongly believe that a helping hand, a warm smile and a tasty pastry smell are all good means to spreading the gospel. We are also in a process of arranging Bible talks with those we are being helped. Our goal is not only providing material food but also spiritual through the living  word of God.

Since we started we experiencing God's presence and help every single day.
